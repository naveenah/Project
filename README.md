# Django SaaS Platform

This repository contains the code and resources for a sample SaaS Application built with Django. This is a base project that can be customized to add various other software services.

## Description

Empower your business to grow with our scalable and flexible SaaS solution. Our platform adapts to your evolving needs, offering a foundation for various services like CRM, project management, or marketing automation. Whether you're a startup or an enterprise, our secure and reliable infrastructure provides the foundation for your success. Access your data from anywhere, collaborate effectively, and unlock new levels of efficiency.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) (version >= 3.10)
* [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/naveenah/Project.git
    cd Project
    ```

2.  Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    # Production dependencies only
    pip install -r src/requirements/requirements-prod.txt
    
    # Or use make commands (recommended)
    make install          # Production only
    make install-dev      # Development + Production
    ```

4.  Set up environment variables:

    Create a `.env` file in the project root with required variables (see Configuration section below).

5. Apply database migrations:
    ```bash
    python src/manage.py migrate
    ```

6. Download vendor static files:
    ```bash
    python src/manage.py vendor_pull
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  Start the Django development server:

    ```bash
    python src/manage.py runserver
    ```

2.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

### Running Tests

To run the automated tests for this project, use the following command:

```bash
python src/manage.py test
```

### Dependency Management

This project uses **pip-tools** for managing dependencies. All requirement files are located in `src/requirements/`:

*   **requirements-prod.in** - Production dependencies (manually maintained)
*   **requirements-prod.txt** - Compiled production requirements (auto-generated)
*   **requirements-dev.in** - Development dependencies (manually maintained)
*   **requirements-dev.txt** - Compiled development requirements (auto-generated)

#### Managing Dependencies

**Using RAV (Requirements Automation & Virtualization):**

RAV automates dependency management and differentiates between development and production environments.

**Production Environment:**
```bash
python rav.py install-prod     # Install production dependencies only
python rav.py setup-prod       # Compile + install production
python rav.py bootstrap-prod   # Full setup from scratch (creates venv)
```

**Development Environment:**
```bash
python rav.py install-dev      # Install dev + production dependencies
python rav.py setup-dev        # Compile + install both dev and prod
python rav.py bootstrap-dev    # Full dev setup from scratch (creates venv)
```

**Common Tasks:**
```bash
python rav.py --list           # List all available tasks
python rav.py compile          # Compile both requirements files
python rav.py upgrade          # Upgrade all dependencies to latest
python rav.py sync             # Sync environment (removes unlisted packages)
```

**Key Differences:**
- `*-prod` tasks: Install only production packages (no testing tools, no pip-tools)
- `*-dev` tasks: Install production + development packages (includes hypothesis, pip-tools)

**Manual dependency management:**
```bash
# Add a new production dependency
echo "package-name>=1.0.0" >> src/requirements/requirements-prod.in
python rav.py compile

# Add a development dependency
echo "pytest>=7.0" >> src/requirements/requirements-dev.in
python rav.py compile
```

**Important:** Never edit `.txt` files manually - they are auto-generated by pip-compile.

### Configuration

Most of the configuration is handled in `src/genapp/settings.py`. For local development, you need to create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```bash
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DJANGO_DEBUG=True
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/dbname  # Optional, defaults to SQLite
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-app-password
```

For production, you will need to configure settings like `SECRET_KEY`, `DATABASES`, and `ALLOWED_HOSTS`.

### Project Structure

The project is organized into several Django apps within the `src/` directory:

*   `ai_agent_gateway`: Manages AI agent triggers and actions.
*   `auth`: Handles user authentication.
*   `checkouts`: Manages the checkout process for subscriptions.
*   `customers`: Manages customer data.
*   `dashboard`: Provides a user dashboard.
*   `genapp`: The main Django project configuration.
*   `helpers`: Contains utility functions.
*   `landing`: Manages the landing page.
*   `profiles`: Manages user profiles.
*   `subscriptions`: Manages user subscriptions.
*   `visits`: Tracks user visits.
