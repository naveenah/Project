### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) (version >= 3.10)
* [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/naveenah/Project.git
    cd Project
    ```

2.  Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
